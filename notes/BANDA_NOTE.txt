Data Preprocessing Memo

Subject: BANDA Preprocessed Data renaming and preprocessing steps

Selected Data Files: (* indicates any subject ID)

    BANDA*_EdEp.nii.gz: Preprocessed DWI data, originally named data.nii.gz.
    BANDA*_EdEp.bval: Gradient b-values, originally named bvals.
    BANDA*_EdEp.bvec: Gradient directions, originally named bvecs.
    BANDA*_EdEp_nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz: Brain mask derived from the b=0 image,
        originally named nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz.

Renaming and  Preprocessing:

The selected files from each subject have been renamed to BANDA*_EdEp to comply
with the BIDS structure utilized in our processing pipeline. The addition of the
"EdEp" suffix reflects that the BANDA team has performed FSL top-up
and eddy corrections during their preprocessing. The original filenames are
preserved in this memo for reference.
